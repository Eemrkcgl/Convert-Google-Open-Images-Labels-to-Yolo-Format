# Convert-Google-Open-Images-Labels-to-Yolo-Format
#Google Open Images is a platform that anyone can download labeled pictures for training AI.
#Google's photo label system is a txt file which includes name of the label, rectangle's bottom left corner coordinates and top right corner's coordinates for each boundingBox.
#This program convert that type to YOLO format which is a txt file that includes a numerator to recognizing the type of stuff that covered by a bounding box, center point's x #value/photos' width, center point's y value/photo's height, boundingBox's width/photo's width and boundingBox's height/photo's height.
#Do not forget to change numerator before run this program
